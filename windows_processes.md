The system process is responsible for the system memory and compressed memory in the NT kernel. 
This system process is a single thread running on each processor. 
It is the host of all kind of drivers (network, disk, USB). 
The related file name is C:\Windows\System32\ntoskrnl.exe. 
The system process in Windows 10 has a additional task, 
it is compressing old pages of memory so that you have more free memory to use.

The system process has always the PID 4 (Process Identification) in the Windows Task Manager, otherwise it is malware.
